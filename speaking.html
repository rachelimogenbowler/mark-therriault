    Mark Therriault is a passionate communicator who believes that hard work, coupled with long term vision and execution, can lead to incredible outcomes. He is described by those who know him best as an unshakeable man, that goes after what he wants, and seemingly finds ways to move around obstacles that come his way.<br /><br />Mark is what you call an experienced learner first, and scholar second. From a starting position as an assistant to the assistants, being demoted (by admittedly his own doing) after coming back from rehab and trying to put the pieces back together in his life in his mid 20&rsquo;s, Mark found ways to not let any barriers get in his way to get to where he wanted to go, and who he wanted to become.<br /><br />Through radical self accountability, and being terrified; but clear on what his long term vision in life is, Mark has not only found incredible success in business, but has also climbed some of the highest mountains in the world to raise funds for various charities. His thirst for adventure also gives him the courage to go after what he wants in all aspects of his life.<br /><br />A self proclaimed recovering addict to all things good and bad, Mark&rsquo;s journey through addiction, self-sabotage, recovery, self love, and ultimate freedom is both inspirational and informational. Through his obsession with his own self work over the last 20 years, Mark has an unconventional and innovative way of seeing business, goal setting, and life.<br /><br />Mark's new goal is to help others find purpose by helping them set short and long term goals through tangible goal planning. He believes everyone can accomplish whatever they want, regardless of how far fetched it might seem now, they just need a plan. Mark's focus on intense goal setting, and relentless effort towards those goals, coupled with the vulnerability of allowing himself to be seen through the lense of all his struggles provides a powerful message to anyone in the audience.

      Finding Your Purpose

      Since I was 26, I started setting 5 year goals. These goals always seemed unacheivable when I wrote them down, but at the end of the 5 years, I always had blown past all of them. I'll take you/your team through the process of how to first determine those 5 year goals, and then create a plan around how one can make sure to achieve those goals, throgh annually and quarterly planning.

        It hasn't been an easy ride for me, but I also know wholeheartidly that I am where I am because of all the things that have happened to me, good and bad. I love sharing my story because I believe it has the power to show others who may be struggling that there is a way out, and you CAN change your outcomes if WANT to.
