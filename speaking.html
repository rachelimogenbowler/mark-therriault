    Mark Therriault joined Nicola Wealth in 2006 as an assistant. After several years of being in the same role, he eventually created his own opportunity to move up, eventually became a partner, and in less than 10 years now manages $500M helping Canadian Entrepreneurs manage their financial affairs. While it is standard that most individuals in the industry focus on just investment management, Mark has also managed to consistently be one of the top producing Insurance advisors in the country over the past few years.<br /><br />But that&rsquo;s not what makes Mark&rsquo;s story so compelling. It&rsquo;s the Journey that got him there that is, and how it led to self discovery, overcoming what felt like unsurmountable obstacles, and how he turned his greatest weaknesses into his greatest strengths.<br /><br />You could describe Mark as someone who pushes the limits, in work and in play, and is a big believer in giving back. Mark has raised $100&rsquo;s of thousands of dollars for charities through high altitude climbs in Alaska, the Himalayas, and Africa, and is a big proponent of pushing his body to the extreme, and facing his fears.<br /><br />Mark&rsquo;s new goal is to help others find purpose by helping them set short and long term goals through tangible goal planning. He believes everyone can accomplish whatever they want, regardless of how far fetched it might seem now, they just need a plan. Mark's focus on intense goal setting, and relentless effort towards those goals, coupled with the vulnerability of allowing himself to be seen through the lense of all his struggles provides a powerful message to anyone in the audience.

      Long Term Goal setting
    </h4>
    <p class="editable">
    Since I was 26, I started setting 5 year goals. These goals always seemed unacheivable when I wrote them down, but at the end of the 5 years, I always had blown past all of them. I'll take you/your team through the process of how to first determine those 5 year goals, and then create a plan around how one can make sure to achieve those goals, throgh annually and quarterly planning.

        It hasn't been an easy ride for me, but I also know wholeheartidly that I am where I am because of all the things that have happened to me, good and bad. I love sharing my story because I believe it has the power to show others who may be struggling that there is a way out, and you CAN change your outcomes if WANT to.
