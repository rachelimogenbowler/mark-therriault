        Vice President, Business Succession and Estate Planning<!-- notionvc: 872aad9a-2f3f-4edf-a9e7-a3afc51bb359 --> at Nicola Wealth,<br />Adventurer and Educator.

      <div class="editable margin-bottom-0">
        <p>After Several years of being in a purely administrative role at his firm, Mark created an opportunity for himself by putting himself out there. He overcame negative perceptions of who he was and took accountability for his life. This led Mark to become one of the Top Financial Advisors in the country (Globe and Mail’s Top Advisors in Canada – Both Provincially and Nationally, as well as Wealth Professionals Top 50 Advisor list) managing assets of over $800M. While it is standard that most individuals in the industry focus on just asset management, Mark has also become the top Producing Insurance Advisor at Nicola and one of the leaders in insurance production across the country. This ultimately led Mark to his current role of Vie President, Business Succession, and Estate Planning.<!-- notionvc: c83447b3-d615-47fd-8458-106a611b64e6 --><br /><br />But that’s not what makes Mark’s story so compelling. It’s the Journey that got him there that is, and how it led to self discovery, overcoming what felt like unsurmountable obstacles, and how he turned his greatest weaknesses into his greatest strengths. You could describe Mark as someone who pushes the limits, in work and in play, and is a big believer in giving back. Mark has raised $100’s of thousands of dollars for charities through high altitude climbs in Alaska, the Himalayas, and Africa, and is a big proponent of pushing his body to the extreme, and facing his fears.</p>

    <h2 class="center">My Story</h2>

      <p class="margin-bottom-2">I've been incredibly blessed with so much in my life, the irony of those blessings is that every one of those blessings has come through so much struggle, sabotage and suffering. I never dreamt in a million years, that I would be in the position I am today, and 10 years ago I doubt anyone would have either. So let&rsquo;s talk about that, as it seems like a good place to start.</p>
