        Vice President, Business Succession and Estate Planning<!-- notionvc: 872aad9a-2f3f-4edf-a9e7-a3afc51bb359 --> at Nicola Wealth,<br />Adventurer and Educator.

      <div class="editable margin-bottom-0">
        <p>Mark Therriault joined Nicola Wealth in 2006 as an assistant. After several years of being in the same role, he eventually created his own opportunity to move up, and in less than 10 years now manages $500M helping Canadian Entrepreneurs manage their financial affairs. While it is standard that most individuals in the industry focus on just investment management, Mark has also managed to consistently be one of the top producing Insurance advisors in the country over the past few years.<br /><br />But that’s not what makes Mark’s story so compelling. It’s the Journey that got him there that is, and how it led to self discovery, overcoming what felt like unsurmountable obstacles, and how he turned his greatest weaknesses into his greatest strengths. You could describe Mark as someone who pushes the limits, in work and in play, and is a big believer in giving back. Mark has raised $100’s of thousands of dollars for charities through high altitude climbs in Alaska, the Himalayas, and Africa, and is a big proponent of pushing his body to the extreme, and facing his fears.</p>

    <h2 class="center">My Story</h2>

      <p class="margin-bottom-2">I've been incredibly blessed with so much in my life, the irony of those blessings is that every one of those blessings has come through so much struggle, sabotage and suffering. I never dreamt in a million years, that I would be in the position I am today, and 10 years ago I doubt anyone would have either. So let&rsquo;s talk about that, as it seems like a good place to start.</p>
